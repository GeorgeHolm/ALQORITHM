# Alqorithm
_A novel quantum algorithm builder_


There are four main deliverables for this project:
1) Website with interface describing work, as well as links to interactive Jupyter notebooks.
2) Jupyter notebook walking users through creating and running their first quantum signal processors and quantum singular value transforms.
3) Jupyter notebook walking users through applying QSP and QSVT developments to make their own quantum algorithms.
4) Presentation summarizing results.
